This mapping remains consistent for the pose model, ensuring that each index corresponds to the same body part across
different detections. This consistency is crucial for applications that require tracking the movement of specific
body parts or analyzing posture over time.

MediaPipe Pose estimation is designed to detect up to 33 landmarks on the human body when conditions allow for it.
However, it may not always detect all landmarks in every frame or image. The behavior when it cannot match some of
those key points depends on several factors, including the model's design, the quality of the input data, and the
specific conditions under which the model is operating. Hereâ€™s how it generally handles such situations:

1. Partial Detection: If the Pose model cannot confidently detect certain landmarks due to occlusion, poor lighting,
or other challenging conditions, it might skip them or provide less accurate positions for those landmarks.
This means that not all 33 landmarks are guaranteed to be detected in every frame or image.
The model's output includes the confidence score for each detected landmark, which can be used to assess
the reliability of each detected point.

2. Consistency in Landmark Indexing: The indexing of landmarks remains consistent across all detections.
For instance, index 19 will always refer to the left index finger if that landmark is detected.
If the model cannot detect the left index finger, it will not assign index 19 to another body part.
Instead, index 19 may either be absent from the output or have a very low confidence score,
indicating uncertainty or non-detection.

3. Adaptation and Tolerance: The Pose model does not dynamically adjust its tolerance or attempt alternative algorithms
to force a match for missing landmarks. The detection and tracking of landmarks are based on the model's trained
capabilities, which include recognizing human anatomical features and understanding typical human body configurations.
The model has been trained on a diverse dataset to generalize across a wide range of poses, body types, and conditions,
but its effectiveness can be limited by the factors mentioned above.

4. Accuracy and Reliability: For critical applications where accuracy is paramount,
it's essential to validate the pose estimation results. You can do this by checking the confidence scores
associated with each landmark and implementing additional logic to handle cases where certain landmarks
are not detected with high confidence. In some applications, it may be necessary to use multiple frames of data
to infer missing landmarks or apply domain-specific knowledge to improve accuracy.

5. Improving Detection Rates: To maximize the detection rate and accuracy of landmark detection:
Ensure good lighting conditions.
Minimize occlusions of key body parts.
Use higher-resolution images where possible.
